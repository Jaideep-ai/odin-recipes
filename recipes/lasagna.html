    <p><strong><em>Fresh </em>Cooked Special Italian Lasagna Dish</strong></p>
    <p>Lasagna would not be so popular today if not for the Romans. While this dish was created in Greece it was not until the Romans conquered the region around 146 BC that the dish became known. The Romans were famous for embracing local customs, cultures, and foods into their society so it wasnâ€™t long before lasagna became commonplace in their cuisine. Rome came to adore the lagonon noodle, a flatbread dough cut into thin strips, then smothered in a various toppings. Under Roman influence, the recipe made its way to Italy where chefs altered it until it became the amazing dish we know today.
